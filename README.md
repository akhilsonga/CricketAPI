## **Introduction**
- Fantasy Sports is a fast-growing industry and has a large consumer base.
- We have developed an API to retrieve data regarding cricket players and their performances.
- The data returned would enable the user to develop in-depth performance analysis of a player or an entire on various permutations and combinations.
- Using our domain knowledge of cricket, we converted some of the raw data points into features that could be readily understood by the user.
